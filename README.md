##### This project will be able to draw the graphs of two mathematical functions at the same time. The graphs will be drawn with two different colors in order to easily diffrentiate between them. Three pairs of functions will be given as an option to the user. It will also display a UI that will let users chose which pair to be drawn. The UI has been built using tkinter.
